# Case

![](../images/ortho4x10tkl-ipadslot.png)

## Plate

To start, get a plate laser cut in 1.5mm

The plate in this repository is _somewhat_ future-proofed with room for multiple spacebar layouts - however, the PCB itself doesn't support all of them as of v0.1

## Bottom Case

There is only one bottom case design at this time, just choose the format you need

## Top Case

Finally, the top case. There are several options:
1. iPad slot 
   1. Designed to hold an iPad mini 6th gen
   2. _May_ hold other devices up to 8mm thickness
   3. Slight 2Â° incline to add support (note: this does NOT tilt the keys themselves)
   4. Smaller 2mm bevels
2. Dimpled
   1. An aesthetic, gently sloped impression which can keep a pen from rolling away
3. Flat
   1. No embellishments

Top case must be chosen for the method of which it is made
* 3D Print (.stl) - requires hex standoffs
* CNC (.step) - requires threads as marked in the technical drawing
  * Can also be used to 3D print if threads are tapped manually
