## Disclaimer

**Offered without warranty or liability! Use/modify/order at your own risk.**

This is my first PCB and for a first attempt it turned out pretty good, but it definitely isn't perfect or thoroughly tested yet.

No customer support, but simple questions/suggestions/improvements may be considered.

If you want to know _how_ or _why_ I did something (especially PCB related) tutorials online can explain it better than I can, so I suggest looking elsewhere.
